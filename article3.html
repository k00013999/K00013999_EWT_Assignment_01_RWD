           <h1 class="feature">Horizon Zero Dawn leads 2018 DICE Awards finalists</h1>
            <h5 class= "summary">A total of 68 games recognized</h5>
            <h4>By Samit Sarkar Jan 15, 2018</h4>
        <p>The nominees for this year’s DICE Awards are in, and the top honoree by far is Guerrilla Games’ Horizon Zero Dawn — the sci-fi action/adventure game received nods in 10 categories.</p>
        <p>Horizon Zero Dawn was the only title to score double-digit nominations; the next highest total went to Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which got six. Both of them are up for the Game of the Year award, alongside StudioMDHR’s Cuphead, PUBG Corporation’s PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and Nintendo’s Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
       <p>In all, 68 different games from 2017 are listed among the nominees across 24 categories. They include heavy hitters like Bungie’s Destiny 2 and MachineGames’ Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, as well as celebrated indies such as Ninja Theory’s Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice and Giant Sparrow’s What Remains of Edith Finch.
           </p>
       <p>Speaking of indie games: In case you’re wondering what the DICE Sprite Award is, it was introduced for 2015’s awards to recognize games with “disproportionate resources for development and exposure (as compared to AAA titles),” ones that “represent a higher degree of risk tolerance and [advance] our industry with innovative gameplay and experiences.”</p>
           <p>Sometimes called the “Oscars of video games,” the DICE Awards are presented by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences (AIAS) at the DICE Summit, a game industry conference held every February in Las Vegas. The finalists for all 24 categories are chosen by a panel of more than 260 game makers, and the AIAS membership of more than 30,000 game industry professionals votes to determine the winners.</p>

Having failed to achieve greatness during the Ancient Era, we enter the Classical not with dreams of grand temples and expanded borders, but with the grim knowledge that all we can do is gather around the hearth fire and ride out the coming storm.<a href="article.html">....more &gt;</a></p>
